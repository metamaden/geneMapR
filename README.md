# geneMappR
Repo containing info and workhorse scripts to aid gene ID mapping and coordinate retrieval.

# Mapping a Gene
Sequence -> Codon -> Transcript -> Isoform -> Isoform Cluster -> Gene Coordinate Range

# Gene IDs
Gene identifiers correspond to any number of different molecular data types, including different types of transcripts.

# Genome Builds
The genome build (and affiliate patch number) corresponds to a designation like "hg##" or "GRCh##" (Genome Assembly from the Genome Reference Consortium). Genomes can be stored a a scaffold sequence, annotated database, or some combination of the two.

# Programmic Mapping
TBD (to discuss programmatic strategies for gene mapping)
